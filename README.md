A bunch of templates for normal text editting usages. This is practically my go-to material for my daily work with LaTeX. Furthermore, I tried to make it informative for a simple training usage. Usually, I prepare both english-based and persian-based scripts, because daily I deal with both. Some of the English templates are basically ready-made [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) templates with my little manipulations in order to get more user friendly and so that any client can run them easily.

In the `report/persian`, I have presented a minimal latex tutorial in persian and prepared a complete template for persian latex writing. The basic template was [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-warwick-report-template/kfpfvcbkdcdk), in which I made minimal changes.
